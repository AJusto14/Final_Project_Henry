# Introduction
We welcome you to our Data Science project, which is based on real and detailed historical datasets related to taxi services in Manhattan, New York. These datasets cover various transportation services, including the iconic yellow taxis, green taxis, for-hire vehicles, and high-volume for-hire vehicles, such as those provided by urban transportation companies like "Uber" or "Lyft," which operate in this city.

Furthermore, our project emphasizes a crucial aspect: the environmental impact of these transportation services on Manhattan. In a context where concerns about air quality and sustainability are growing, we are committed to analyzing how taxis contribute to carbon emissions in the city. Our goal is to offer possible solutions and opportunities in the electric vehicle market to taxi companies. This not only increases their profits but also contributes to environmental care.

# Objectives
1. **Promote Electric Vehicle Adoption**: One of our main goals is to convince the project owner of the effectiveness of electric vehicles as a solution to reduce environmental pollution caused by transportation services using fossil fuels, such as taxis. We aim to present strong arguments supported by data and analysis that demonstrate the economic and environmental benefits of transitioning to electric vehicles.

2. **Develop a Machine Learning Model for CO2 Prediction**: Another fundamental objective is to create a Machine Learning model capable of predicting the concentration of carbon dioxide (CO2) in the air of Manhattan for the upcoming months and years. This model will provide a better understanding of carbon emissions trends and assist in making informed decisions regarding environmental and transportation policies.

3. **Create an Interactive Travel Analysis Dashboard**: To provide a comprehensive view of mobility in Manhattan, we plan to develop an interactive dashboard displaying detailed analyses of taxi trips, as well as high-volume urban transportation companies like Uber and Lyft, in the city's 69 neighborhoods. This dashboard will enable the company to explore travel patterns, demand trends, and other relevant data, making data-driven decisions to enhance urban mobility and reduce environmental impact.

# Data Source
Our project relies on data from various sources to conduct comprehensive analysis. These data sources are essential for providing insights into different aspects of transportation and environmental impact in Manhattan, New York.

1. **NYC Taxi & Limousine Commission (TLC)**: We utilize historical and current data on trips from various types of public transportation services in the city of New York. This data source offers valuable information about taxi services, including yellow cabs, green cabs, and more. You can access the data at [NYC TLC Trip Record Data](https://www.nyc.gov/site/tlc/about/tlc-trip-record-data.page).


2. **Air Pollution Data from OpenWeather.org API**: We collect data on air quality based on the coordinates of Manhattan. This data source allows us to monitor air pollution levels and their impact on the city. For more information, visit [OpenWeather.org API - Air Pollution](https://openweathermap.org/api/air-pollution).


3. **Noise Project Data**: To understand noise pollution in Manhattan, we use data filtered for specific zones and neighborhoods. This data helps us assess the noise levels in different areas and their potential effects. You can access the data at [Noise Project Data](https://noiseproject.org/data-download/).
